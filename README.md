## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer:** Do not replace your entire `settings.json` file with the content of `app-windows-terminal.json`. Doing so will erase your existing profiles and settings. Instead, follow the steps below to add the color scheme manually.

1.  **Open Settings**: In Windows Terminal, open the **Settings** tab (you can use the `Ctrl + ,` shortcut). In the bottom-left corner, click on **Open JSON file**. This will open your `settings.json` file in your default text editor.

2.  **Add the Color Scheme**: In the `settings.json` file, find the `schemes` array. If it doesn't exist, you can add it. Copy the following JSON object and paste it inside the `schemes` array.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Flat Cap",
        "background": "#1c1e22",
        "black": "#1c1e22",
        "blue": "#7a90a2",
        "brightBlack": "#42474e",
        "brightBlue": "#8ea5b9",
        "brightCyan": "#56b6c2",
        "brightGreen": "#98c379",
        "brightPurple": "#c678dd",
        "brightRed": "#e06c75",
        "brightWhite": "#fcfdff",
        "brightYellow": "#d19a66",
        "cursorColor": "#56b6c2",
        "cyan": "#a3bbce",
        "foreground": "#e4e6eb",
        "green": "#98c379",
        "purple": "#c678dd",
        "red": "#e06c75",
        "selectionBackground": "#2d3036",
        "white": "#e4e6eb",
        "yellow": "#d19a66"
    }
    ```

3.  **Apply the Theme**: Now, you need to apply this scheme to one of your profiles (like PowerShell, Command Prompt, or WSL).
    - Find the `profiles` object and then the `list` array inside it.
    - Choose the profile you want to change and add or modify the following line:
      ```json
      "colorScheme": "Flat Cap"
      ```
    - Alternatively, to apply it to **all** profiles, add this line to the `defaults` object within `profiles`:
      ```json
      "profiles": {
          "defaults": {
              "colorScheme": "Flat Cap"
          },
          "list": [ ... ]
      }
      ```

4.  **Save**: Save the `settings.json` file. Windows Terminal will automatically apply the changes.

## Philosophy

Flat Cap draws inspiration from the fantastic design logic of the **[Nord theme](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord)**, embracing its principles of calm, clean aesthetics, and a dimmed pastel color approach. However, Flat Cap diverges significantly in its color palette, which is uniquely derived from the visual language of the latest **Horizon OS** iterations by Meta for Oculus Quest. This fusion results in a theme that is both familiar in its minimalist comfort and fresh in its distinct, modern color scheme.

## Color Palette

The Flat Cap theme is built upon a carefully curated and expanded color palette, designed for granular control and visual harmony across various UI elements and syntax highlighting. The palette is divided into four main categories: Deep Twilight, Dawnlight, Ocean Blues, and Vivid Accents.
